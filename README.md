# Pokemon_GO

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a full Data Science Project to prove my skills and get an astonishing job offer at EKT as a Data Scientist. 

The Objective of this project is preprocess, train and apply a classification model able to recognize 10 distinct Pokémon’s trough a variety of attributes.
We will be using a Random Forest Classifier after data preparation to render a CSV file containing the prediction after training our model on the first dataset.
